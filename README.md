Rashid E-commerce is a full-stack e-commerce website that I developed using React, HTML, and JavaScript. The website allows users to browse through a wide range of products, add items to their cart, and complete their purchase using Google authentication.

To enhance the user experience, I utilized the useContext hook to manage global state and enable dynamic cart functionality. This feature allows users to easily add, remove, and update items in their cart without having to navigate away from the current page.

In addition, I integrated Google authentication to ensure the security of user data and streamline the checkout process. This allows users to sign in to their Google account and automatically populate their billing and shipping information, making the checkout process quick and hassle-free.

Overall, Rashid E-commerce showcases my skills in front-end web development and my ability to create responsive and user-friendly e-commerce websites using modern web development technologies.
